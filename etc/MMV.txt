MMV file format description
MMV files consist of a 224-byte header, followed by an optionalsave state chunk, then the movie data.

Header format:

     0000: 4-byte signature: "MMV\0"
     0004: 4-byte little endian unsigned int: dega version
     0008: 4-byte little endian unsigned int: frame count
     000c: 4-byte little endian unsigned int: rerecord count
     0010: 4-byte little endian flag: begin from reset?
     0014: 4-byte little endian unsigned int: offset of state information
     0018: 4-byte little endian unsigned int: offset of input data
     001c: 4-byte little endian unsigned int: size of input packet
     0020-005f: string: author info (UTF-8)
     0060: 4-byte little endian flags
       bit 0: unused
       bit 1: PAL
       bit 2: Japan
       bit 3: Game Gear (version 1.16+)
       bits 4-31: unused
     0064-00e3: string: rom name (ASCII)
     00e4-00f3: binary: rom MD5 digest

Controller data format
Controller data is made up of one input packet per frame. Each packet currently consists of 2 bytes. The first byte is for controller 1 and the second controller 2. The Game Gear only uses the controller 1 input however both bytes are still present. The bit layout is:

   bit 0: up
   bit 1: down
   bit 2: left
   bit 3: right
   bit 4: 1
   bit 5: 2
   bit 6: start (Master System)
   bit 7: start (Game Gear)

On the Master System bit 6 will only be set for one frame when the button is depressed.
